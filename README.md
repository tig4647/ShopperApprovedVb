# ShopperApprovedVb
This is a vb console app for using the Shopper Approved API for Reviews.
There is not really any documentation with them, so I created a class to handle the Shopper Api.
I am writing the json to a file.
You can get your API/Token from ShopperApproved.com under advanced tools.
Newtonsoft is required.
